Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code.
It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently.
Common commands include git add, git commit, git push, and git pull.
Branches enable parallel development and feature isolation.
Merge conflicts occur when the same lines are modified in different branches.
GitHub and GitLab are popular platforms for hosting Git repositories.
